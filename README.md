<p><i>The application is for training purposes only.</i></p> 
<p>Status: not complete.</p> 
<p>The main purpose of creating the application is to get the practice 
of building relationships between entities. Another goal is to learn 
how to work with images as byte arrays: uploading, saving in db, 
obtaining from db and rendering on HTML page. Finally, another goal 
is training in teamwork. It was assumed that I would provide the server 
part as well as HTML and JavaScript in a minimal amount, and then 
my friend would rewrite the frontend part using React.js (also for training purposes). 
At the moment, the goal has not been achieved.</p>
