<p><i>The application is for training purposes only.</i></p> 
<p>Status: incomplete.</p> 
<p>A simple online store using the REST design principles. 
The main purpose of creating the application is to get practice 
of building relationships between entities. Another goal is to learn 
how to work with images as byte arrays: uploading, saving in db, 
obtaining from db, scaling, sending to client and rendering on HTML page. 
Finally, there was a goal of training in teamwork. It was assumed that 
I would provide the server part as well as HTML and JavaScript in a 
minimal amount, and then my friend would rewrite the frontend part 
using React.js (also for training purposes). 
At the moment, the goal has not been achieved.</p>
